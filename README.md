![alt text](https://github.com/eosineye1/sam/blob/main/assets/samimage.png? "SAM Start Page")

## Aim
The aim of SAM is to help in small business decisions by utilizing data to drive those decisions.

## Problem
Over my years as a data analytics minor, I realised that to analyze data, one must have a basic knowledge of data analytics tools such as excel and/or python/R. However, most business manager may not have the knowledge needed to operate these tools effectively and may require a data analyst. However, some business decisions are minor/small and do not utiize the full capacity of the data analyst. That's where SAM comes in.

## Solution

SAM aims to allow managers to quickly generate visual represntaion and information from data which can be used to drive business decisions. Moreover, SAM is fast, efficent, and user-friendly, which gives everyone the ability to be a data analyst in seconds.
